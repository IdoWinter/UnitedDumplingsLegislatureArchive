], doc)
== General Provisions
===
In the general elections, citizens shall be provided with two distinct ballots: one designated for the election of the Prime Minister and the other for the election of Parliament members.
===
The election process for Parliament shall remain in accordance with existing electoral laws and regulations.

== Election of the Prime Minister
===
The election of the Prime Minister shall be conducted through a direct electoral process by the populace.
===
Each eligible voter shall cast one vote on the designated ballot for their preferred Prime Ministerial candidate.

== First-Round Electoral Threshold
===
Should a Prime Ministerial candidate secure 40% or more of the total valid votes cast in the first round, the candidate with the most votes shall be declared the winner and duly elected as Prime Minister.
===
The calculation of the 40% threshold shall exclude any null and void ballots, focusing solely on valid votes.

== Second-Round Election (Runoff)
===
In the absence of a candidate achieving the required 40% threshold in the first round, a second-round election shall be initiated, featuring the two candidates with the highest number of votes from the first round.
===
The second-round election shall be scheduled no later than 30 days following the announcement of the first-round results.
===
The candidate who receives the majority of votes in the second round shall be declared the winner and duly elected as Prime Minister.

== Tie-Breaking Mechanisms
===
In the event of a tie for the second-highest number of votes in the first round, necessitating clarification on the candidates to proceed to the second round, a tie-breaking game of Chwazi shall be conducted within the *same meeting* of the election results announcement.
===
The tied candidates shall participate in the Chwazi Game under the supervision of the Electoral Commission, with the winner securing a place in the second-round election.
===
In the unlikely event of a tie in the second-round election, a subsequent Chwazi Game shall be organized within the *same meeting* to determine the final election winner.

== Electoral Commission Oversight
===
The Electoral Commission shall be responsible for the oversight, administration, and facilitation of both rounds of the election, ensuring transparency, fairness, and adherence to the democratic principles enshrined in this amendment.
===
The Electoral Commission shall also oversee the conduct of the Turtle Board Game tie-breaker, ensuring it is conducted in a manner that upholds the integrity of the electoral process.

== Conditional Extension and Permanency
===
This amendment is initially effective for the upcoming (6th) general election only. Its application to subsequent elections is not automatic.
===
For the separate electoral system for the Prime Minister as outlined in this amendment to extend beyond the immediate next election, a formal review and approval must be conducted by Parliament.
===
Such review shall take place no later than 5 meetings following the conclusion of the upcoming general election. During this period, Parliament shall assess the efficacy, fairness, and public reception of the separate electoral process.
===
Approval for extension beyond the next election requires a majority vote within Parliament. If approved, this separate electoral system for the Prime Minister shall become a permanent feature of the electoral process.
===
In the absence of parliamentary approval, the electoral system reverts to the pre-amendment method for all future elections until such time that further amendments may be made.

== Commencement
===
This amendment shall come into force immediately upon ratification, applicable from the next scheduled general elections.
===
Transitional provisions shall be established to guide the implementation of this amendment in the forthcoming elections.
